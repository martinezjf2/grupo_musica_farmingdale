  sdj-about-context:
    "Paul was an active man in the persecution of the Church and Christians, but because of the power of heaven and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, he changed completely and became one of God's great servants.

It is acquiring virtues; it is being a true disciple of Jesus Christ."
  sdj-about-value1: "Humility"
  sdj-about-p1:
    "Jesus Christ was very humble from the premortal life. In the Council of Heaven, He recognized God's will and allowed it to prevail in the Plan of Salvation for humanity. He said, 'Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever' (Moses 4:2)."
  sdj-about-value2: "Courage"
  sdj-about-p2:
    "Let us have the courage to do what is right, even if it is not popular; the courage to defend our faith and act with faith. Let us have the courage to repent daily, the courage to accept God's will and obey His commandments. Let us have the courage to live righteously and to do what is expected of us in our various responsibilities and callings."
  sdj-about-value3: "Forgiveness"
  sdj-about-p3:
    "Let us sincerely forgive one another to obtain the Father's forgiveness. Forgiveness makes us free and worthy to participate in the Sacrament each Sunday. Forgiveness is required for us to be true disciples of Jesus Christ."

    header: "What is a Catholic Mass?"
    subtitle: "The Catholic Mass is a sacred celebration where believers gather to worship and receive the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ."
    p1: "During the Mass, various rituals and prayers take place. The Liturgy of the Word includes readings from the Bible, including the Old Testament, Psalms, and Gospel. These readings are followed by a homily, where the priest explains and applies the Scriptures to our lives."
    p2: "The Liturgy of the Eucharist is the central part of the Mass. It involves the consecration of bread and wine, which become the true Body and Blood of Christ through transubstantiation. The faithful participate in Holy Communion, receiving the real presence of Jesus."
    p3: "The Mass is not only a commemoration of Christ's sacrifice on the cross but also a participation in it. It is a source of grace and spiritual nourishment, strengthening the faith of believers and fostering unity in the Church."
    p4: "Regularly attending Mass is of great importance for Catholics. It allows them to deepen their relationship with God, receive His grace, and be united with the Church community. The Mass provides an opportunity for worship, prayer, and encountering Christ in a profound way."

    header: "Confessions: Why They Are Important"
    p1: "Confession is the act of acknowledging and expressing our sins or wrongdoings before God. It is an essential aspect of the Christian faith and holds great significance in our spiritual journey."
    p2: "Confessions provide us with the opportunity to humble ourselves before God, seeking His forgiveness and purification. Through confession, we acknowledge our need for His grace and mercy, recognizing that we have fallen short of His perfect standards."
    p3: "Confessions are important because they allow us to experience the freedom and joy that come from receiving God's forgiveness. By confessing our sins, we open ourselves to His transformative power, allowing Him to work in our lives and achieve healing and restoration."
    p4: "In many Christian traditions, confessions take place during regular worship services or in designated spaces within the church. However, confessions can also be made privately, directly to God, in the quietness of our hearts."
    p5: "It's important to note that confession is not a one-time event but an ongoing practice. As we strive to live a life aligned with God's will, we will inevitably stumble and make mistakes. Confessions serve as a constant reminder of our need for God's grace and as a means to maintain a healthy and authentic relationship with Him."
    p6: "Take time to reflect on your life, seek God's forgiveness, and make confessions as needed. Embrace the transformative power of confession and experience the abundant life that God has prepared for you."

            emphasizes the universal call to holiness and mission in the
            Catholic Church."
    p3: "During his installation homily, Bishop Barres appealed to inactive
          Catholics to rediscover the power of the Word of God, the power of the
          Sacrament of Penance, and the power of the Catholic Mass. He
          encouraged and challenged active Catholics to invite one inactive
          Catholic friend or family member to Mass; to gently, compassionately,
          non-judgmentally witness the beauty of their intimacy with Christ and
          their love for the mission of the Catholic Church."
    p4: "His ministry to the Diocese began immediately. At the start of Lent in
          2017, Bishop Barres called on Catholics to pray for dramatic
          missionary growth in the Diocese of Rockville Centre, and reiterated
          his installation challenge to active Catholics about inviting one
          inactive Catholic back to Mass."
    p5: "In May 2017 in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Blessed
          Mother’s apparitions in Fatima, Portugal, Bishop Barres released his
          first pastoral letter entitled “Miracle of the Sun.” The letter was an
          invitation to the faithful to join him in praying the rosary daily
          during the month of May for the promotion of dramatic missionary
          growth on Long Island."
    p6: "During the summer, Bishop Barres ministered to Catholics in many ways.
          In June 2017, Bishop Barres ordained five men to the diocesan
          priesthood."
    p7: "In July 2017, Bishop Barres conducted the first Quo Vadis Leadership
          Camp in the Diocese of Rockville Centre, to promote an increase in
          vocations to the priesthood and religious life. Quo Vadis was a
          five-day, four-night experience for young men and women at the
          Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington that demonstrated
          the richness found in the religious life and priesthood on Long
          Island."
    p8: "To reach commuters suffering from long train delays during the summer
          of 2017, Bishop Barres created with Telecare (now Catholic Faith
          Network), the diocesan television network, an innovative daily video
          series entitled “The Catholic Spirituality of Commuter Delays.” The
          two-month series refocused the reality of commuter delays as disguised
          missionary moments and well-hidden times of God’s presence among us."
    p9: "In response to an invitation by Bishop Barres, His Eminence Jose
          Gregorio Cardinal Rosa Chavez of El Salvador, who worked closely with
          Blessed Oscar Romero as a young priest, visited the People of God of
          the Diocese of Rockville Centre in August 2017. His four days were
          grace filled as Cardinal Rosa Chavez celebrated the global missionary
          spirit of Pope Francis and promoted dramatic missionary growth on Long
          Island. Cardinal Rosa Chavez touched the hearts of thousands during a
          packed schedule of pastoral visits to the local communities on Long
          Island and at Masses attended by thousands of worshippers. Cardinal
          Rosa Chavez brought the light of Christ to communities grappling with
          immigration issues and gang violence. Along with Father Daniel Rivera
          and seminarian (now Father) Roger Velasquez, Cardinal Rosa Chavez
          appealed to the Hispanic community to promote vocations to the
          priesthood and religious life."
    p10: "In September 2017, Bishop Barres received the St. John’s University
          Gold Medal, awarded to individuals who exemplify a commitment to
          service and the St. John’s University mission. At that time he
          delivered an address entitled, “The Relationship between Catholic
          Sacramental Theology and Catholic Social Justice Teaching: The
          Sacrament of Penance in Service of ‘Welcoming the Stranger.’” He gave
          the Keynote Meditation on September 11, 2017 to the leadership of the
          United Nations."
    p11: "On September 26, 2017, Bishop Barres visited the Holocaust Memorial
          and Tolerance Center of Nassau County in Glen Cove. He was deeply
          moved by the experience and was able to spend time with the staff and
          Board members."
    p12: "In October 2017, Bishop Barres announced a major commitment to the
          ongoing healing of survivors of acts of child sexual abuse committed
          by clergy. He announced the Independent Reconciliation and
          Compensation Program (IRCP) for the Diocese of Rockville Centre. The
          Program is a critical and tangible step toward reconciliation, healing
          and compensation for these survivors of abuse."
    p13: "On November 18, 2017, Bishop Barres joined ecumenical leaders for the
          500th Anniversary of the Reformation Prayer Service at the parish of
          Saint Kilian in Farmingdale. Bishop James Massa, auxiliary bishop of
          the Diocese of Brooklyn delivered an inspiring homily and Bishop
          Barres offered remarks about the ecumenical opportunities around
          Spiritual Theology and works of English Anglican spiritual theologian
          Evelyn Underhill (1875-1941)."
    p14: "In the pursuit of dramatic missionary growth on Long Island, Bishop
          Barres has promoted a partnership with the Augustine Institute for a
          dynamic Senior Year of Catholic Apologetics for Catholic High School
          students on Long Island and the use of FORMED (A Catholic version of
          Netflix) in the parishes of the diocese. In the course of two months,
          the number of parishes enrolled in FORMED rose from 20 to 93 parishes.
          Bishop Barres has also promoted a partnership with FOCUS (Fellowship
          of Catholic University Students) so that four Catholic missionaries
          could work with the Catholic chaplain and campus ministers at Stony
          Brook University, a flagship university in the State University of New
          York system."
    p15: "In his pastoral letter for April 2018 entitled “The Dream and Our
          Deepest, Truest Selves,” Bishop Barres commemorated the life and
          mission of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the 50th Anniversary of
          his assassination and offered reflections on Dr. King’s message, life
          and death through the lens of Catholic theology and spirituality."
    p16: "Bishop Barres wrote a chapter in the recently released book Apostolic
          Athletes: 11 Priests and Bishops Reveal How Sports Helped Them Follow
          Christ’s Call. Bishop Barres reflects on how sports helped shape his
          early life and his response to a call to the priesthood. He looks at
          his years as a Princeton University JV point guard and how the Holy
          Spirit helped develop his leadership through that experience."
    p17: "At the May 11, 2018, Commencement Exercises of St. Joseph’s Seminary
          (Dunwoodie, New York), Bishop Barres delivered the Keynote Address
          entitled “Avery Cardinal Dulles and the Future of Catholic Apologetics
          in America.”"
    p18: "In July 2018, Bishop Barres was one of the representatives of the
          USCCB Evangelization and Catechesis Committee to participate in the V
          Congreso Americano Misionero: America en Mision, el Evangelio es
          alegria in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. It was a powerful experience of
          praying, reflecting and applying Pope Francis’ global missiology
          grounded in the corporal and spiritual works of mercy in a global
          missionary congress."
    p19: "On July 25, 2018, Bishop Barres issued a Pastoral Letter entitled “The
          Supreme Gift: The Gift of Life – Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of
          Pope Blessed Paul VI’s Encyclical Letter: Humanae Vitae.” He writes:
          “Marriage is a gift that God gave to men and women at the beginning of
          creation, and with that gift comes the responsibility of fulfilling a
          special mission. That mission is not only to share the joy of life
          with Him, but also to share with Him the joy of creating. Spouses are
          given the mission by God to serve as co-creators of new human life.”"
    p20: "In September 2018, Bishop Barres with a large delegation from the
          parishes of the Diocese of Rockville Centre joined with diocesan
          delegations from around the country in Grapevine, Texas to celebrate
          and reflect on the fruits of the Fifth Encuentro and to chart future
          evangelization and leadership directions for the Church in the United
          States. Bishop Barres was subsequently asked to join the USCCB
          subcommittee on Hispanic Affairs."
    p21: "On October 14, 2018, Bishop Barres issued a Pastoral Letter entitled
          “Archbishop Saint Oscar Romero: A Catholic Martyr who made the Holy
          Sacrifice of his Life while Celebrating the Holy Sacrifice of the
          Mass.” The Bishop invoked the memory and intercession of this new El
          Salvadoran Saint: “We take yet another opportunity to connect the
          Canonization, in a spirit of pastoral charity, promotion of human
          rights and global justice, to a call for comprehensive immigration
          reform for our nation that is built on the principles of the dignity
          of the human person, social justice, the sanctity of human life and
          the family, and a Good Samaritan love for the poor.”"
    p22: "In September 2019, Bishop Barres issued a Pastoral Letter entitled “Ya
          Gotta Believe!” which celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the 1969
          Amazing New York Mets winning the World Series. The Bishop writes:
          “Drawing on the inspiration of the 1969 Miracle Mets, the Catholic
          Church on Long Island can experience a new era of Catholic
          Evangelization and dramatic missionary growth against all the odds and
          expectations, and even become a model for the country!”"
    p23: "On October 13, 2019, Bishop Barres issued a Pastoral Letter entitled
          “Heart Speaks to Heart,” which celebrates the canonization of St. John
          Henry Cardinal Newman. The Bishop wrote: “May Saint John Henry Newman,
          now fixed among that ‘great cloud of witnesses’ assist us. In a
          special way, may he help us in our spiritual lives to seek truth,
          accept sufferings, and share our faith from the heart. From his place
          giving ‘praise to the Holiest in the height,’ may he inspire us to
          acknowledge truth, orient our conscience towards it, and imbue the
          conversations of society with it.”"
    p24: "On October 14, 2019, Bishop Barres issued a Statement on Comprehensive
          Immigration Reform: “On the First Anniversary of the Canonization of
          Saint Oscar Romero October 14, 2019.” The Bishop wrote: “A Year later,
          on the first anniversary of St. Romero’s canonization, and in unity
          with the many fine statements and interventions of the United States
          Conference of Catholic Bishops concerning the plight of refugees,
          non-documented immigrants, the separation of families and dismay over
          a broken immigration system, I renew my own call for comprehensive
          immigration reform in this country and globally…May the great and holy
          martyr, Saint Oscar Romero, intercede for us in our efforts to promote
          a just and comprehensive immigration reform in this country and around
          the world as part of a burgeoning Culture of Life.”"
    p25: "In November 2019, a special issue of The Long Island Catholic magazine
          was dedicated to reflection on Pope Francis’ Apostolic Exhortation to
          the Youth of the World, Christ is Alive. The Bishop wrote: “The Holy
          Father is now 82 years old and yet he shows in his voice and his tone
          that a spirit of holiness and mission is a youthful spirit at any age.
          When Christ is alive and real in our lives, we can experience a
          grace-streaming fountain of youth in every season of life. The Holy
          Father in his age, in his wisdom and in his youthful spirit addresses
          young people in a moving and heart-felt way that can inspire and
          motivate them.”"
    p26: "Bishop Barres participated in the November 11-15, 2019 New York State
          Catholic Bishops’ Ad Limina visit to Rome. In addition to a November
          15, 2019 Audience with Pope Francis, the New York Bishops had meetings
          with Roman dicastery officials and celebrated Mass at St. Peter’s
          Basilica, St. John Lateran, St. Mary Major and St. Paul
          Outside-the-Walls."
    p27: "On January 27, 2020 at the Trusteeship Council Chamber of the United
          Nations, Bishop Barres – joined by Bishop Richard Henning and Fr. Lee
          Descoteaux – participated in a conference dedicated to commemorate
          Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th Anniversary of the Liberation
          of Auschwitz entitled “Remembering the Holocaust: The Documented
          Efforts of the Holy See and the Catholic Church to Save Lives.”"
    p28: "The conference was jointly sponsored by the Permanent Observer Mission
          of the Holy See to the United Nations and the Pave the Way Foundation.
          The Holy See was represented by Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Gabriele
          Caccia and the Moderator Monsignor Fredrik Hansen."

          Edouard Huson, Professor Johan Ickx, Gary Krupp, Professor Matteo
          Napolitano, Mark Riebling, Professor Ronald Rychlak and Professor
          Limore Yagil."
    p30: "Bishop Barres stated: “It was a moving and illuminating interfaith
          experience to share with our Jewish brothers and sisters. Gary Krupp,
          President of the Pave the Way Foundation, gave an address entitled,
          ‘The Documented Truth about the Holy See’s, Pius XII’s and the
          Catholic Church’s Work to Save Jews during World War II’ and gave a
          powerful summary and synthesis at the end of the fine and precise
          research that had been presented by the scholars at the conference.”"
    p31: "Bishop Barres uses social media to spread the Gospel message. He has
          the Twitter handle @Bishop Barres, and tweets three times each day. He
          also has a program on Catholic Faith Network, entitled “Encounter.”
          Bishop Barres writes a monthly column, “Holiness and Mission,” for The

          newspaper of the Diocese of Rockville Centre."
    p32: "Nationally, Bishop Barres serves as a member of the United States
          Conference of Catholic Bishops Subcommittee on Hispanic Affairs, which
          is part of the Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church. In June
          2019, Bishop Barres was asked to join the Episcopal Board of Trustees

    h3: "The Journey to the Diocese of Rockville Centre"
    p34: "Bishop John Oliver Barres was born September 20, 1960, and raised in
          Larchmont, New York. He was the first son of Oliver and Marjorie
          Catchpole Barres, Congregational ministers who met at the Yale
          Divinity School and converted to Catholicism in 1955. The story of
          their conversion is told in Oliver Barres’ book published in 1955, One
          Shepherd, One Flock. Bishop Barres was baptized by renowned preacher
          Bishop Fulton J. Sheen in 1960 while his father worked for Bishop
          Sheen’s Propagation of the Faith magazine in New York City. Bishop
          Barres is the fifth of six children, and has seven nephews and four
          nieces."
    p35: "Bishop Barres graduated cum laude in 1978 from Phillips Academy. In
          1982, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English
          literature from Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, where he
          also played three years of junior varsity basketball during the era of
          Basketball Hall of Fame Coach Pete Carril. Bishop Barres went on to

          his Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology in 1988 and Licentiate in
          Systematic Theology in 1989."
    p36: "Bishop Barres was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of
          Wilmington on October 21, 1989 by Bishop Robert Mulvee. Bishop Barres
          began his priesthood as an associate pastor at parishes in Newark and
          Wilmington, Delaware. He continued his theological education in Rome,

          and earned his Licentiate of Canon Law in 1998 and Doctorate in Sacred
          Theology in 1999."
    p37: "Upon returning to the Diocese of Wilmington in 1999, Bishop Barres was
          appointed Vice-Chancellor and then Chancellor of the Diocese. Pope
          John Paul II named him a “Chaplain to His Holiness” in July 2000 with
          the title of “Monsignor.” Pope Benedict XVI named him a “Prelate of
          Honor” in November 2005."
    p38: "After serving the Diocese of Wilmington for almost 20 years, Bishop
          Barres, at age 48, was named the fourth Bishop for the Diocese of
          Allentown, Pennsylvania by Pope Benedict XVI on May 27, 2009. He was
          ordained and installed as Bishop of Allentown on July 30, 2009, by His
          Eminence Justin Cardinal Rigali, Archbishop of Philadelphia, at the
          Cathedral of Saint Catharine of Siena in Allentown. Bishop Barres was
          the first priest ordained a bishop within the Diocese of Allentown.
          Principal co-consecrators were Bishop William Francis Malooly, Bishop
          of Wilmington and Bishop Michael Angelo Saltarelli, Bishop Emeritus,
          Diocese of Wilmington."
    p39: "Through some innovative approaches to Catholic education and pastoral
          strategic planning, the New Evangelization mission of the Allentown
          Diocese was strengthened. Bishop Barres wanted the Church to reach out
          and help young Catholics find their way spiritually. As Bishop he took
          to social media by establishing a Twitter handle and a weekly video
          blog. He would tweet up to three times each day in order to reach out
          to younger Catholics."
    p40: "As shepherd of the Diocese of Allentown, Bishop Barres initiated a
          vibrant diocesan-wide Saint Thomas More Society for lawyers, focused
          on local efforts to educate the faithful on the importance of
          protection for religious liberty. He also established an aspirancy
          program for young men considering a call to the priesthood. Under
          Bishop Barres’ leadership, the diocese expanded its Hispanic ministry
          and evangelization."
