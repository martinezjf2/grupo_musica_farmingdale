  sdj-about-heading-values: "OUR VALUES"
  sdj-about-heading: "Followers Of <span class='highlight'>Jesus</span>"
  sdj-about-context:
    "Paul was an active man in the persecution of the Church and Christians, but because of the power of heaven and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, he changed completely and became one of God's great servants. His role model was the Savior Jesus Christ. Being a follower of Christ involves striving to adapt our actions, behavior, and life to those of the Savior. It is acquiring virtues; it is being a true disciple of Jesus Christ."
  sdj-about-value1: "Humility"
  sdj-about-p1:
    "Jesus Christ was very humble from the premortal life. In the Council of Heaven, He recognized God's will and allowed it to prevail in the Plan of Salvation for humanity. He said, 'Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever' (Moses 4:2)."
  sdj-about-value2: "Courage"
  sdj-about-p2:
    "Let us have the courage to do what is right, even if it is not popular; the courage to defend our faith and act with faith. Let us have the courage to repent daily, the courage to accept God's will and obey His commandments. Let us have the courage to live righteously and to do what is expected of us in our various responsibilities and callings."
  sdj-about-value3: "Forgiveness"
  sdj-about-p3:
    "Let us sincerely forgive one another to obtain the Father's forgiveness. Forgiveness makes us free and worthy to participate in the Sacrament each Sunday. Forgiveness is required for us to be true disciples of Jesus Christ."
